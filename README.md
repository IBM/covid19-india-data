# Covid-India-data

**Goal**: Availability of COVID related data is crucial for researchers to understand the behavior and model the progression of the pandemic. While a structured database with this information is not currently available for India, individual states and cities provide detailed information in their daily media bulletins about the current situtaion of COVID-19 in their respective states.

The goal of this project is extract all the available information from these daily health bulletins and create a structured database of the information. We hope this database enables researchers easy access to more data than is currently available through other sources.
