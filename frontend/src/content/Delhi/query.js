        Delhi state uses the cheaper, quicker, but less accurate Rapid Antigen
        tests along with the more reliable and accurate but more time taking
        RTPCR tests to detect COVID-19 cases. The state has been questioned for
        its excessive use of Rapid Antigen Tests in the past leading to a false
        sense of security [

        ]. This chart plots the ratio of RTPCR tests to the Rapid Antigen Tests
        in Delhi. In the initial phases of the pandemic, RTPCR tests comprised
        only 20-40% of the total tests performed, implying an excessive reliance
        on Rapid Antigen Tests. This ratio has however improved with time, and
        during the second wave, as much as 80% of the total tests conducted were
        RTPCR tests.

        This figure looks at the hospitalization rates in Delhi (occupied
        hospital beds / number of active cases). While the hospitalization rate
        during the initial waves of COVID-19 is estimated to be around 40-50%,
        it is comparatively higher during the deadly second wave and is
        estimated to be around 60-65%.
